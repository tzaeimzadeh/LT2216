### MLT course, LT2216 Final Project

For my final project, I have created a musical game using songs from (Disney) movies. There are two levels. In one level, the 
system sings a verse of a song and the user can guess either the title of the song, or what movie it is from. In the other 
level, the system sings a verse of a song and the user has to sing the next verse.
